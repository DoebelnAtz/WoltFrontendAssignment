Project made for Wolt Frontend summer 2020 internship

The task was to sort 50 restaurants by name in ascending and descending order.

The frontend is built using React and styled-components. 

I did not implement blurhash or testing due to time constraints, but I love the idea
behind blurhash and will use it in any future projects.



Things to improve:
    
    Pagination, not showing all 50 resturants on one long page.
    Testing
    Sorting menu behaviour
    Implementing blurhash

To run:

    1. Clone the repository
    2. Run npm install
    3. Run npm start
